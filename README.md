# Roadmap
A complete roadmap for learning data structure and algorithms for anyone keen to learn DSA, from scratch. 
5 steps to learn DSA from scratch
step 1:
      Learn at least one Programming Language
step 2:   \
      Learn about Complexities
step 3:   
      Learn Data Structure and Algorithms
      1) Array
      2) String
      3) Linked List
      4) Searching Algorithm
      5) Sorting Algorithm
      6) Divide and Conquer Algorithm
      7) Stack
      8) Queue
      9) Tree Data Structure
      10) Graph Data Structure
      11) Greedy Mehtodology
      12) Recursion
      13) Backtracking Algorithm
      14) Dynamic Programming
step 4:
      Practice, practice and practice more
step 5:      
      Compete and become a pro
